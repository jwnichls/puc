General Bugs:
-------------
* Need a better edit control for manipulating structured data
* Multiple list selections is currently unimplemented
* Implicit dependencies among list items is currently unimplemented
* what are some more list patterns that should be implemented?
* list manipulation smart templates


PocketPC PUC
------------
* Need a rule specifically for read-only mutual exclusive situations
  (tabs don't quite work) - see problems with elevator and Denali
  climate control  
* Way to better layout the generic list view?  The scrollbar in its 
  current form doesn't really make sense.
* Method for dealing with multi-line widgets
   - Multi-line string widget
   - Label sizing bug?  I wonder if sometime the labels are automatically 
     wrapped, which leads the layout algorithm to make a mistake because
     it is only considered width.
* Rules that search for common patterns across overlapping panels and
  create similar layouts on each panel
* Generalize the existing Fix Layout rule


Debug Server
------------
* DebugServer doesn't size panels properly
* Need a method for assigning values for undefined variables if they
  are have a cyclic dependency (maybe dependencies don't apply in the
  DebugServer?) 
* need method for debugging with binary and list data
* unlabeled appliance objects should use name as label
* semi-automated regression testing


Smartphone
----------
* proper support for the back button
* boolean list-item widget
* rule for grouping widget list items
* one-dimensional read-only list support
* Need to modify mutual-exclusion rules so that unavailable items are
  not shown (see problem with elevator) - might be related to
  read-only mutual exclusion case


Desktop PUC
-----------
* Appliances should each appear in different window
* better list support - one-dimensional read-only cases don't work


New Appliances
--------------
* UPnP device to talk with Rhapsody UPnP server
* Build a device that controls whether the video output is on or not
  on a laptop (another multi-appliance system with powerpoint,
  lighting and projector control).


PUC Documentation
-----------------
* PUC/2.2 language features in specification docs?


Fixed
-----
* Ability to run PUCProxy for one device (probably a separate app)
* Device discovery messages are undocumented
* password in elevator sim not working (dependency problem?)
